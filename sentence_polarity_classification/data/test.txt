0	it trusts the story it sets out to tell .
0	a full world has been presented onscreen , not some series of carefully structured plot points building to a pat resolution .
0	there are many definitions of 'time waster' but this movie must surely be one of them .
0	just a collection of this and that -- whatever fills time -- with no unified whole .
0	the work of an artist tormented by his heritage , using his storytelling ability to honor the many faceless victims .
0	the film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when carvey's saturday night live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment .
0	one thing is for sure : this movie does not tell you a whole lot about lily chou-chou .

0	the stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny .
